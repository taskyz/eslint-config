# @taskyz/eslint-config

This library contains the eslint configuration used by taskyz. It is a private library.

## Installing the library in another project locally

Since the organization is private, you'll need to be a member of the organization to install the library.

You'll need to generate a personal access token from [github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic).

1. Install the library using npm cli:

   ```bash
   npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com --scope=@taskyz

   > Username: Github Username
   > Password: Github Personal Access Token
   ```

You can now install the library using npm:

```bash
npm install @taskyz/eslint-config
```
